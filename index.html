    <h1> What is ESG? </h1>
    <p>ESG, short for environmental, social, and (corporate) governance, is a set of standards used to evaluate a
        business’s operational performance as it relates to social and environmental impact.</p>
    <p>Environmental pillar covers climate change, energy usage and efficiency, greenhouse gas emission, air and water
        pollution, waste management, biodiversity, etc. Social pillar covers community engagement, equal opportunity,
        employee benefit, customer satisfaction, data security and privacy, labor and human rights, etc. Governance
        pillar covers business integrity, financial transparency, regulatory compliance, risk management,
        leadership diversity, etc.</p>

    <h1> ESG Risk </h1>
    <p>In a famous speech given on 29 September 2015, then Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, warned that
        financial stability may be undermined by the increasing financial risks linked to climate change and
        identified three major risks: </p>
    <p>Physical risks are strictly linked to the physical effects of climate change. There can be acute physical
        risks caused by disruptive events (cyclones, hurricanes, floods, etc.) or chronic physical risks caused by a
        longer-term shift in climate patterns (e.g. higher temperature and consequent food and water scarcity
        because of drought). Physical risks may have financial implications for households and organisations, such
        as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption; </p>
    <p>Transition risks are linked to the transition to a less polluting, greener economy, which may lead to changes
        in the value of a wide range of assets. They are associated with regulatory changes (e.g. stricter rules for
        CO2 emissions) and technological changes (e.g. electrification of the car industry) due to the
        decarbonisation process. On the demand side, they can be caused by a change in consumer behaviour due to an
        increased environmental consciousness. Transition risks may have financial implications for organisations,
        such as stranded assets and higher costs of doing business; </p>
    <p>Liability risks are strictly linked to the consequences of the above two risks. The actual trend shows an
        increasing number of litigation procedures from individuals and business claiming compensation for losses.
        There can be claims for failed attempts to mitigate the impacts of climate change, to adapt to climate
        change, or to disclose climate-related risks to shareholders. As pointed out in the latest Climate Chance
        2020 Report, the financial sector may become a target of climate-related litigation, and this risk is
        already perceptible.</p>

    <h1>ESG Funds</h1>
    <p>Funds, like ETFs and mutual funds, may consider a wide range of factors that are consistent with their objectives
        and strategies when selecting investments. This can include ESG, which stands for environmental, social, and
        governance.</p>
    <p>ESG investing has grown in popularity in recent years, and may be referred to in many different ways, such as
        sustainable investing, socially responsible investing, and impact investing. ESG practices can include, but are
        not limited to, strategies that select companies based on their stated commitment to one or more ESG factors
        —for example, companies with policies aimed at minimizing their negative impact on the environment or companies
        that focus on governance principles and transparency. ESG practices may also entail screening out companies in
        certain sectors or that, in the view of the fund manager, have shown poor performance with regard to management
        of ESG risks and opportunities. Furthermore, some fund managers may focus on companies that they view as having
        room for improvement on ESG matters, with a view to helping those companies improve through actively engaging
        with the companies.</p>
    <p>Funds that elect to focus on companies’ ESG practices may have broad discretion in how they apply ESG factors to
        their investment or governance processes. For example, some funds integrate ESG criteria alongside other
        factors, such as macroeconomic trends or company-specific factors like a price-to-earnings ratio, to seek to
        enhance performance and manage investment risks. Other funds focus on ESG practices because they believe
        investments with desired ESG profiles or attributes may achieve higher investment returns and/or encourage
        ESG-related outcomes. For example, some ESG funds select companies that have shown their commitment to a
        particular ESG factor, such as companies with policies aimed at minimizing their negative impact on the
        environment. Some funds may implement shareholder voting rights in particular ways to achieve ESG goals, while
        others may only focus on selecting investments based on ESG criteria.</p>
    <p>Fund managers focusing on ESG generally examine criteria within the environmental, social, and/or governance
        categories to analyze and select securities.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The environmental component might focus on a company’s impact on the environment—for example, its energy use
            or pollution output. It also might focus on the risks and opportunities associated with the impacts of
            climate change on the company, its business and its industry.</li>
        <li>The social component might focus on the company’s relationship with people and society—for example, issues
            that impact diversity and inclusion, human rights, specific faith-based issues, the health and safety of
            employees, customers, and consumers locally and/or globally, or whether the company invests in its
            community, as well as how such issues are addressed by other companies in a supply chain.</li>
        <li>The governance component might focus on issues such as how the company is run—for example, transparency and
            reporting, ethics, compliance, shareholder rights, and the composition and role of the board of directors.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>An ESG fund portfolio might include securities selected in each of the three categories—or in just one or two of
        the categories. A fund’s portfolio might also include securities that don’t fit any of the ESG categories,
        particularly if it is a fund that considers other investment methodologies consistent with the fund’s investment
        objectives.</p>

    <h1>Sustainability Finance</h1>
    <p>Sustainable finance is an evolution of green finance, as it takes into consideration environmental, social and
        governance (ESG) issues and risks, with the aim of increasing long-term investments in sustainable economic
        activities and projects.</p>
    <p>Climate finance provides funds for addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation, green finance has a
        broader scope as it also covers other environmental goals (e.g. biodiversity protection/restoration), while
        sustainable finance extends its domain to environmental, social and governance factors (ESG).</p>
